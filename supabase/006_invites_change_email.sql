-- 006: invites and fixing a mistyped email, for both apps (Operations and the Team app share this project and its logins).
-- Additive: two new functions, nothing existing changes. Safe on a project without the Team app: its tables and
-- functions are only touched when they exist. The same file is in the Team app repo (hr/supabase/007_...).
